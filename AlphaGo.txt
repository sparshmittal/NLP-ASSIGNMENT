AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go. It was developed by DeepMind Technologies a subsidiary of Google. It uses a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to find its moves based on knowledge previously acquired by machine learning, specifically by an artificial neural network by extensive training, both from human and computer play. A neural network is trained to identify the best moves and the winning percentages of these moves. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in stronger move selection in the next iteration. AlphaGo collects moves for 30 million board positions. Then it applies the backpropagation in deep learning to train the model parameters. AlphaGo uses 50 GPUs to train the network and it takes 3 weeks. In October 2015, in a match against Fan Hui, it became the first computer Go program to beat a human professional Go player. In March 2016, it beat Lee Sedol, a 9-dan professional, in a five-game match. In recognition of the victory, AlphaGo was awarded an honorary 9-dan by the Korea Baduk Association. The win by AlphaGo was chosen by Science as one of the Breakthrough of the Year runners-up on 22 December 2016. At the 2017 Future of Go Summit, it beat Ke Jie, the number one ranked player in the world at the time, in a three-game match, after which it was awarded professional 9-dan by the Chinese Weiqi Association. After the match between AlphaGo and Ke Jie, DeepMind retired AlphaGo, while continuing AI research in other areas. Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful, including a version that competed under the name AlphaGoMaster. After retiring from competitive play, AlphaGoMaster was succeeded by an even more powerful version known as AlphaGoZero, which was completely self-taught without learning from human games. AlphaGoZero was then generalized into a program known as AlphaZero, which played additional games, including chess and shogi. AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded by a program known as MuZero which learns without being taught the rules.
